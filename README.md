# Introduction

This a my project that I created during a wonderful udacity python class. It is a little movie library showing my favorite movies.
The main parts of this projects are:
  * entertainment_center.py : This file represents our little database with hard coded objects inside. Further it calls a function which renders and opens a html page.
  * media.py : Inside we find our movie class which will be used by entertainment_center to create instances of this class
  * fresh_tomatoes.html: An html file of our movie library
  * fresh_tomatoes.py: A file given by udacity that takes an array of movies and renders them into html
